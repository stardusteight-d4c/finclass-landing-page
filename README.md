   Finclass, Landing Page
</h1>

To add interactivity and improve the user experience, the Framer Motion library is used to create custom and fluid animations. With this, the landing page stands out visually and can catch the attention of visitors.

In addition, the use of TypeScript helps to ensure that the code is more robust and scalable, reducing the occurrence of errors and making code maintenance easier.

This landing page is an example of how the use of modern technologies can help create an efficient and attractive web application, offering an improved and consistent user experience.

### <strong>Roadmap</strong>

Visual representation of the steps a user can take to achieve a specific goal, such as learning a new skill or mastering a technology. These roadmaps can include a series of steps to follow, such as resources to read, tutorials, videos and projects to complete.

They are useful for guiding users through their learning process, providing a clear structure and a sense of direction. Roadmaps can also help increase user retention on a platform, as they provide a clear and organized way to track progress and achieve goals. In addition, they can be customized according to each user's needs and experience level, making the learning process more effective and satisfying.

### <strong>Call to Action</strong>

Call to action (CTA) are elements on a landing page that encourage the user to perform a specific action, such as clicking a button, filling out a form, purchasing a product or subscribing to a newsletter. The main purpose of CTAs is to convert visitors into leads or customers, increasing the page's conversion rate. CTAs should stand out visually and have a clear, persuasive message that conveys a sense of urgency or benefit in carrying out the proposed action. Some examples of CTAs include buttons with texts such as "Buy now", "Register", "Download ebook", "Request quote", among others.

### <strong>Feedbacks</strong>

Consumer feedback is an important part of the product and service development process. They are the opinions, comments and reviews that customers leave about the product or service they received. This feedback can be collected in a variety of ways, such as surveys, comments on social media or directly contacting customer support.

Feedback is valuable for companies as it provides information about how their products or services are being perceived by customers. This helps to identify strengths and areas that need improvement, allowing the company to make informed decisions on how to improve its products and services.

Furthermore, customer feedback can be used as a marketing tool, helping the company create more effective marketing messages and increase customer confidence in its brand. By publishing testimonials and positive comments, the company can demonstrate customer satisfaction and increase its credibility.

Therefore, collecting, analyzing and responding to consumer feedback is a fundamental part of the product and service development and marketing process.
