To add interactivity and improve the user experience, the Framer Motion library is used to create custom and fluid animations. With this, the landing page stands out visually and can catch the attention of visitors.

In addition, the use of TypeScript helps to ensure that the code is more robust and scalable, reducing the occurrence of errors and making code maintenance easier.

This landing page is an example of how the use of modern technologies can help create an efficient and attractive web application, offering an improved and consistent user experience.
